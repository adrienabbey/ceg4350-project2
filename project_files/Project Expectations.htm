<p>The project for an operating system course typically has at least the
following dual goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to make you <i>use</i> an existing OS in a skilled way in building larger
    programs than you have so far, as well as
  <li>to make you think about the <i>design</i> of such an OS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are applicable to all your work (projects, home work, and
exams) in the course, and will not be repeated in later handouts.</p>
<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
<p>These projects must be work done <i>solely by you</i>, except for any of the
parts I provide.</p>
<h2>Quality of Code</h2>
<p>The implementation must be in <tt>C or C++</tt> demonstrable on our <tt>Unix</tt>
systems.</p>
<p>Subsequent parts build on the code you write. Make sure your source code <em>quality</em>
is high. It is a subjective judgment. To be concrete about it, I suggest a few
specifics below. Follow them vigorously, even if unwillingly. As you become a
mature programmer, you will (guaranteed ;-) come to appreciate the benefits of
this rigidity in style.</p>
<p>Keep the routines (methods), and files small. No routine should exceed, say,
20 lines (not counting comment lines). No file should exceed, say, 200 lines, or
4000 bytes. Some times a method is no bigger than a couple of lines. Do not
hesitate to turn a code segment into a routine/method because it is then going
to be called just once.</p>
<p>For every routine/method, carefully document its pre- and post-conditions.
Caller is expected to satisfy the pre-conditions prior to the call. The method
is designed and coded assuming that the pre-condition holds. To improve
robustness, you may want to check the pre-condition, but, it is not expected
that you do. The caller, upon return, expects that the called routine has
accomplished what has been described in the post-condition.</p>
<h2>Clarifications</h2>
<p>Part of (large) program development is independently, but wisely, deciding 
what to do for certain &quot;erroneous&quot; situations. Should we ask the professor for 
what to do for every possible error you can think of? [Answer: No. You think 
about it. You take a reasonable action. You document this in your source code, 
and in <code>ReadMe.txt</code>. And, be ready to defend your choice should it be 
questioned.]&nbsp; Should <code>SimDisk</code>() constructor <code>printf</code> or
<tt>cout&gt;&gt;</tt> an error message? [No.] When does/should <code>mkSimDisk</code><tt>()</tt> 
return a zero? [Think.]&nbsp; Remember that one of the goals of CEG 433/633 is to 
make you think about larger programs. Part of this is to supply missing, but 
needed, details in the problem description. </p>
<p>Post all your questions, helpful comments, criticisms, and suggestions
regarding this project to our channel on the department's <a
	href="https://discord.gg/pMUMzTt">Discord server</a>. I am
hoping for a lively discussion leading to good answers and clarifications. <em>Keep
an eye on this Discord channel.</em></p>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>All submissions are done through pilot. The following files, with names <i>exactly</i> as indicated, must always be
submitted.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>ReadMe.txt</tt>: This file must include (i) your name, and e-mail
    address, (ii) a listing generated by <tt>ls -l</tt> of the directory
    containing your project files, (iii) an explanation of how the project was
    accomplished using the above files, and (iv) highlights both the good points
    and <i>bugs</i> and problems that it has.&nbsp; In (iii) make sure you are
    documenting the <em>design</em>, not just coding, of your program.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Must have the targets <tt>test</tt>, <tt>$(PROJECT)</tt>,
    and <tt>clean</tt> properly prepared. The value for <code>PROJECT</code>
    must change from P1 to P4 as we progress. The <code>Makefile</code> must set<br>
    <tt>CFLAGS = -c -g -Wall -ansi -pedantic</tt></li>
  <li><tt>TestScript.txt</tt>: Think about how you will verify that your program
    is functioning correctly. Note that the <tt>shell</tt> of P1 reads from
    stdin and writes to stdout/stderr. So, we can prepare a text file <tt>TestScript.txt</tt>
    of input for our shell and run it as <tt>shell &lt; TestScript.txt </tt>The
    test run should demonstrate that all the features of the current part are
    exercised.</li>
  <li><tt>typescript</tt> of a successful <code>make test</code>. If I <tt>cd</tt>
    to your directory, and run the command <tt>make test</tt>, a clean, a
    compilation of all files, a link of all object code files into the
    executable <tt>$(PROJECT)</tt>, followed by a successful test run should
    happen.</li>
  <li>Source code files, with your choice of names. These must have been pretty
    printed in a standard style. Learn to use<tt> indent -kr.</tt></li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading Sheet</h2>
<p>A typical grading sheet is shown below. This is just a sample and not an actual grading sheet we will use to score your submissions. Each assignment has its own grading sheet at the bottom of the assignment description.&nbsp; We try to read your code.&nbsp;
But we depend mostly on observed execution of your code.</p>
<p>All work for this course is expected to be done on a Linux system.
Our grading of your submitted
project work includes the execution by us on a current Linux machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonus points are awarded in recognition of good work, in addition to the max
possible points.&nbsp; Quality is subjectively judged.&nbsp; Merely turning in a
file will not receive full score.&nbsp;Bonus points are used not in &quot;curving&quot; 
but in possibly pushing an individual student's grade up.</p>
<p>Subsequent parts build on the code you write. So, make sure your source code <em>quality</em>
is high.</p>
<p>Some of the above have a cascading effect.</p>
